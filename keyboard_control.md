# Keyboard Controls

Whether you use a touchscreen with your PiDeck or not, a USB keyboard makes an inexpensive controller for xwax.

The keyboard shortcuts on the PiDeck are a little different from standard xwax, as we modify some of them for single-key action.
Some of the crate functionality is hidden in the PiDeck GUI but remains accessible via these keyboard shortcuts.

## Library Controls
