# Keyboard Controls

Whether you use a touchscreen with your PiDeck or not, a USB keyboard makes an inexpensive controller for xwax.

The keyboard shortcuts on the PiDeck are a little different from standard xwax, as we modify some of them for single-key action.
Some of the crate functionality is hidden in the PiDeck GUI but remains accessible via these keyboard shortcuts.

## Library Controls

| Key  |  Function  |
| --- | --- |
| Up \\ Down  | Scrolls through the library  |
| Page Up \\ Page Down  | Scrolls through the library one page at a time  |
| Left \\ Right  | Scrolls through the crates specified at startup  |
| Tab  | Toggles between selected crate and all tracks  |
| Left Shift  | Changes track sorting order between Artist, BPM and Playlist  |
| Left Ctrl | Rescan media library  |

You can also search your library by typing any letters or numbers. Delete the search term with the backspace key in order to see your full library again.


## Deck Controls

Deck control in xwax is done via the function keys. F1 - F4 control deck zero, F5 - F8 control deck 1 and F9 - F12 control deck 2.
